# Subject Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Subject Management system for the Officer Dashboard with proper form styling and API integration.

## What Was Created

### 1. Subject Service (`/src/services/subjectService.js`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all API calls to the subject service backend
- **API Endpoints Implemented**:
  - `GET /api/subject` - Get all subjects
  - `GET /api/subject/{id}` - Get subject by ID
  - `POST /api/subject` - Add new subject
  - `PUT /api/subject/{id}` - Update subject
  - `DELETE /api/subject/{id}` - Soft delete subject
  - `POST /api/subject/{id}/restore` - Restore deleted subject
  - `GET /api/subject/deleted` - Get deleted subjects
  - `GET /api/subject/search/{name}` - Search subjects by name

### 2. Subject Components (`/src/components/subjects/`)

#### SubjectForm.jsx
- **Purpose**: Form component for adding and editing subjects
- **Features**:
  - Subject name validation (2-100 characters, alphanumeric with special chars)
  - Weight validation (positive number, max 100, up to 2 decimal places)
  - Real-time form validation with error messages
  - Loading states during submission
  - Clear visual feedback for form errors

#### SubjectList.jsx
- **Purpose**: Table component for displaying subjects
- **Features**:
  - Displays subject ID, name, weight, created/updated dates
  - Action buttons for edit/delete/restore
  - Different styling for deleted subjects
  - Empty state handling
  - Responsive table design

#### SubjectManagement.jsx
- **Purpose**: Main container component for subject management
- **Features**:
  - Tab navigation (Active/Deleted subjects)
  - Search functionality by subject name
  - Add/Edit/Delete/Restore operations
  - Success/Error message handling
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Loading states

### 3. Enhanced Styling (`/src/components/subjects/SubjectManagement.css`)
- **High Contrast Form Fields**: 
  - Blue borders (#007bff) for better visibility
  - Gradient backgrounds for form inputs
  - Clear focus states with box shadows
  - Error states with red borders and backgrounds
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Professional UI**: Consistent with existing student management design

### 4. Route Integration
- **Added Route**: `/subjects` in App.jsx
- **Protection**: Uses ProtectedRoute wrapper for authentication
- **Navigation**: Accessible from Officer Dashboard

## Officer Dashboard Integration

The Officer Dashboard (`/src/components/dashboards/OfficerDashboard.jsx`) already includes:
```jsx
{
  title: 'Subjects',
  description: 'Manage subjects and curriculum',
  link: '/subjects',
  icon: 'ðŸ“š'
}
```

When officers click the "Subjects" card, they are redirected to `/subjects` which loads the SubjectManagement component.

## Form Field Styling Highlights

### Input Fields
- **Background**: Gradient from white to light gray
- **Border**: 3px solid blue (#007bff) for high visibility
- **Focus State**: Darker blue border with box shadow
- **Error State**: Red border (#ff0000) with light red background
- **Typography**: Bold, black text for maximum readability

### Validation Features
- **Subject Name**: 
  - Required field
  - 2-100 characters
  - Alphanumeric with spaces, periods, ampersands, hyphens, apostrophes
- **Weight**: 
  - Required field
  - Positive number (0.01 to 100)
  - Maximum 2 decimal places
  - Helpful placeholder and description

## API Path Verification

All API paths match the backend implementation in `main.bal`:
- Base URL: `/api/subject`
- All endpoints properly configured
- Authentication headers included via interceptors

## Testing

### Frontend
- Development server running on http://localhost:5173
- React Router navigation working
- Component imports resolved
- CSS styling applied correctly

### Backend Integration
- API paths verified against main.bal
- Authentication interceptors in place
- Error handling implemented
- Loading states managed
